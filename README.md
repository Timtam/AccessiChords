<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Chords are an important, if not the most important part of music. As soon as you're composing a piece of music in REAPER, you'll come across chords and will have to insert them into your MIDI editor. No problem if you are able to play them with your favourite MIDI controller, but more of a hassle when programming your music manually via keyboard, or if you are unable to play an instrument. 

Thats probably the reason why the [ChordGun scripts][chordgun-url] where invented. Those were ment to provide a nice-looking interface and the ability to get a quick overview over all chords available and the possibility to quickly shoot them into your project whenever you need them.

Unfortunately though, those ChordGun scripts are not accessible for visually impaired users. The interface is not accessible at all, neither with JAWS nor NVDA, not under Mac nor Windows. Thats why I started this project. Let's AccessiChords be the successor of ChordGun - at least for VI people.

As such, AccessiChords provides a way to quickly access all chords related to a note selected with the pitch cursor and inject them into your MIDI editor at the current position and with the given grid size. See [Usage](#usage) for more information.
